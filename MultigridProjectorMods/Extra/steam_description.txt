[h2]Remarks[/h2]
[list]
[*] Upon loading the self-repair projection "Keep projection" is automatically enabled.
[*] This is [b]not[/b] a "mod version" of the Multigrid Projector!
[*] Despite its name this mod also works with the vanilla game.
[*] It is a regular mod which needs to be added to the world as usual.
[*] Some features added in the future may require the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415983416]MGP client plugin[/url] to work.
